# ProceduralContent
Project I made for my degree in Computer science.

##Controls
W/A/S/D to move the camera.
Shitft/Control to make Pedestal movement (move the camera in Y axis).
E/Q to pan the camera (Rotate clockwise - counter clockwise).

You can change the properties of the terrain, number of prefabs and the direction-
magnitude of the wind. The prefabs are fixed into a set of figures which they
resemble some organic vegetal life (it means that they are created with fixed
parameters in real time).

You can also change the where the prefabs spawn by typing the name of the biome 
into their spawn zone. The names of the biomes are below (in "controls"). If the 
name you introduce doesn't match any biome, no prefabs will be created.
